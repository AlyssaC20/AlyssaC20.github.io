My name is Alyssa Cole. I was born in Indianola, Mississippi, but currently I reside in Madison, Mississippi. I recently graduated in May 2016 from Germantown High School, where I finished in the top ten percent of my class, and graduated with honors. In the fall, I will be attending Xavier University of Louisiana as a Biology Pre-Med major. During my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends, as well as reading or listening to music by myself. I have worked for the Malco Theater franchise from September 2015 to May 2016 and have held leadership positions in my high school. I was a senior class representative this past year and participated in the Beta Club, Future Business Leaders of America, and the St. Jude Steering Committee. In the past I was a part of the softball team, choir, and Speech and Debate.
